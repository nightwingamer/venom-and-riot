    <p> venom and riot in my oppion those are the two best syimboites in the world. riot can make any weapons from his two hands an axe or a sword anything. however venom can not he  can use one hand to make a shield and extend his claws. the winner between the two is venom because it does not matter how strong the syimboite is its how strong the host is eddie brock is venoms host and was a more trained host then riots host was. WARNING VENOM IS A PG-13 MOVIE PARINTAL GUIDENCE ADVISED!!! in my opinon venom is the best between the two. NO! he is better then all of them<p>
